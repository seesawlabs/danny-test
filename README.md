## Weather App/Logger

### API
Use OpenWeather API

**API KEY:** b1f9075afcb92b7cd9b494ede3b6b182  
**Example:** http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=78759,us&appid=b1f9075afcb92b7cd9b494ede3b6b182


### User Stories
- [ ] As a user, I want to know what the current temperature for my zip code is in Farenheit so that I know if I should wear a sweater.
- [ ] As a user, I need to see my previous zip code searches so that I can see what days I wore a sweater.

### UI

**Proposed Workflow:** The user first sees a form for a Zip Code.  After clicking the "Submit" button, they will see the current temperature in Farenheit.  Once there has been at least one search, the user will see a new link that will take them to a report of all zip code searches that have been made on the system.
